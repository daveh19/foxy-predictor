## Predicting the German 2017 Elections
### A project for 2017 BCCN Advanced Scientific Programming Course

The inspiration of the project comes from behind the scenes of
the politics modelling engine at https://fivethirtyeight.com/

Our product is capable of:
    (i) storing political polls in a restful API
    (ii) fit these data to different modelling engines
    (iii) producing predicted outputs for the future behaviour of the system
    (iv) visualize the results in a prediction timeline, a chairs distribution
          and a interactive map
