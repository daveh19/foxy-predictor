Backend
- What do we need to run
endpoints.py, which hosts the REST API

- What populates the database
Calling curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/parties/polls 
erases the tables and scrapes data from the web, does the necessary preprocessing and parsing, 
then posts to the DB again.

This endpoints runs endpoints.loadPollingData().

- How can we update the DB
See the previous answer.

-- Does this overwrite/append the DB

Erase&Post. 

-- What are the calls to access the DB
from APICalls import getPollingData 
getPollingData() # federal data 
getPollingData(state=True) # state data

- Where do we gather data from (one website, or an aggregate)
    sources = {'wahlrecht_country': 'http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/',
               'wahlrecht_states': 'http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/laender.htm'}

--- Manual stop of backend

Models
- What is the command needed to run a model
- Are there any specific model perks
- How are the Monte-Carlo Simulation initialised and run

Visualisation
- Do we have a plot that we want to produce wrapped in a function now
-- Move the former code in a BAK folder
- Nice to have a function, per graphic, to produce plots individuall from comman-line python (Very nice ++)

CLI
- Does it perform integration with every element
-- What features do not work
-- What features have we coded, elsewhere, that are not accessible from CLI

GUI
- POC

AWS
- Automate build process (should have automated the creation, access and maintenance)
- What do we need to clone to run AWS-EC2 in future 
- How do we run docker image
-- What commands specifically
- Container to be in detatched mode (? - hiding?)
- Make cron job: 1:00 download and then new predctions, one static web-page per prediction
