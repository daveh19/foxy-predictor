STRUCTURE OF OUTPUT: 

each model should output a pandas file containing the columns
described below. Ideally everytime the modell function is executed 
this pandas file is loaded and a new row of data is added.

date of prediction              # datetime 

prediction for 'CDU'            # float

prediction for 'Gruene'         # float
prediction for 'FDP'            # float
prediction for 'Linke'          # float

forsa                           # bool, indicating whether data from this institute was used

startdate                       # datetime, date of earliest datapoint used for prediction
enddate                         # datetime, date of latest datapoint used for prediction
