Goal: Complete first full end-to-end product with command line interface. 


1. Back-end
Preprocessing the collected data frames from the web. -> Finished
Building general scraping class for all websites used.  -> still work to do
Scraping the state polls -> Finished but needs cleaning

2. Command line interface 
Integration of visualization and scraping scripts finished, foxy predictor has a nice interface.
TODO: Models need to be written generically so that one can choose from terminal

3. Models
Research on mixed linear models and Bayesian poll-pooling
Generic function for calculating past predictions for visualization and validation purposes implemented.

4. Visualization
Dashboard still causes problems, hard to actually get just one dashboard to open up.
Approaches so far: 
Creating one plot with several subplots (did not work)
Extracting html and create combined html (promising)
Also, script for interface integration finished so that MVP works.
