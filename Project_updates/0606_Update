Goal: To refine iteration 1 of MVP Status: In-Progress Target: 13th of May 2017 

1. David discussed the potential to use Gaussian Processes for the modelling 

2. Updates of each sub-group as follows:

Back-end
    API is now complete - all data is being pulled into the database. The next stage is to complete this for all state data.
    This does need to be tested - particularly in the surveys in which no people have been asked. This should have NULL or N/A entries.
    
    State Data:
    Cleaning data from states has been a tricky process due to the inconsistency within each data source - essentially a 'mess!'
    Examples include - lack of dates and the brackets.
    80% percent of the cleaning has been acheived
    
Command Line
    All commands have been written to accept entries (i.e. pulling of data, plotting, modelling)
    Currently data does not call database rather the function to pull from cleaned version of the websites
    An addition to the manipulation of the data is to automate the individual date views to be a week basis 
    
Modelling
    Update based on three options:
    a) Regression Model (Completed)
    b) Linear Mixed Model
    c) JAGS (Just another Gibbs Sampler) - Bayesian Inference using Markov Chain with Monte-Carlo
    Issue is the package is not available
    
    d) Gaussian Process (used SKlearn Gaussian_Process, want to further explore with GPflow and pymc3)
    
Visualisation
    Have successfully been able to produce an HTML webpage to present the two graphs using Jinga (web template framework)
    Next week will work on drop down boxes and the interactive dashboard
