Goal: To complete end-to-end product Status: In-Progess Target: 11:30am 30th  of May

1. David provided a recap of the products to be delivered 

2. Two to three sub-groups had performed the same work - important that all team members are aware of their responsibilities for the day.
Communication is key

3. Updates of each sub-group as follows:

Back-end
    Added state(regional) data sets
    Cleaning the data, multiple inconsistencies including wrong data types, different inputs for same columns
    Acknowledged they are working better and in more unison. 
    
Integration to Backend
    Panda data structure complete with JSON integrator 
    Command line interface created to initiate the 'pull'
    
Modelling
    Focus on building three options:
    a) Regression Model
    b) Linear Mixed Model
    c) JAGS (Just another Gibbs Sampler) - Bayesian Inference using Markov Chain with Monte-Carlo
    Issue is the package is not available
    
Visualisation
    Working on ways to initiate the visualisation plots using command line (potential issues with pyplot)
    Worked on a command line interface (potential duplicate for the Integration, can leverage same structure)
