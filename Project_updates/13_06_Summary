Goal: To deliver iteration 1 of MVP Status: In-Progress Target: 120th of June 2017 

1. While a goal to finish the MVP was 11:30 a number of issues needed to be resolved within each stream. Good progress was however made!

1. Updates of each sub-group as follows:

Back-end
    Converting data from JSON to Pandas
    Parsed table as per the standard used by visualisation and and modellers
        Mapd date and name
        Pull data function (with each name and full)
    
Next Time: 
1. Complete functions for Landers data
2. Testing for all functions to be performed

Pre-Processing
    To convert all weeks from polling dates to make it uniform to reiterate from previous weeks

Next time:
3. Provide options to average weeks (simple, weighted, which pollster)

Modelling
    Gaussian Process into a function (incl standard nonclementure)
    Monte Carlo last data point (predicted data point) - multivariate normal distribution

    Most likely outcome for each point - PDF of each outcome per party

Next time:
4. Work on nicer model for future (transtion matrix - keeps probability fixed)
5. Or (and) create a new model

Scripting:
    Performs all interactions except Monte Carlo
    Can visualisation the polling data

Next time:
6. Tweak
7. Saves as pickled file

Visualisation:
    Decided to use CSS Flexbox (easier way to map which)
    Investigated more on Map on Germany - image scatter plot (color update on each state)
    Which percentage
    Played around with weights of the points (lighter than the older)
    Plotly interactive scatter plot (Germany interactive filling in the map - not asthtetically pleasing - point in the state)

Next Time:
8. GUI

Docker Server
    Server Built with Docker installed and GFlow, Python 2.7, Pandas
    
Next Time:
9. Complete base installation 
10. Provide 'simple' ssh authentication method
