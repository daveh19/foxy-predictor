1. Updates of each sub-group as follows:

Back-end
    included Länder data into db by adding extra column with länder / national. 
    TODO include last column in pull request, also adjust models accordingly
     
    need testing for all functions to be performed

Pre-Processing
    functionality for preprocessing available, need to return pandas still
    averaging by num of participants included

Modelling
    Gaussian Process into a function
    included MC prediction for election day
    Bayesian model ready, needs to be included into model class
    
Next time:
4. Work on nicer model for future (transtion matrix - keeps probability fixed)
5. Or (and) create a new model

Scripting:
    generally works well, need to implement new functions


Visualisation:
    Map of gemany with arbitrary valuews, need to use right data
    alex improved plotting

Next Time:
8. GUI
