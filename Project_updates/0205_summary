1. Discussed and agreed on the MVP:


A product that would be able to predict the election results in Germany based on the secondary vote, which uses a structured back end. The results are visualised in two charts (an election seat diagram and a timeline prediction graph).


2. The working Groups were confirmed and each focused on the design today:


Back-end

  *   Outlined the types of data to be used
  *   Identified the database system to be used
  *   Identified ~20 odd polling systems
  *   Worked on a JSON request structure


Modelling

  *   Researched what data could be useful to use
  *   Researched algorithms or techniques that have been published to predict polling data i.e. 'Chancellor Appeal Algorithm
  *   Discussed the Monte-Carlo simulation and applicability for the project


Visualisation

  *   Identified several types of visualisation techniques to be used
  *   Installed 'plotly' package and simulated types of plots based on Dummy Data


3. At the end of the session each group was asked to provide an update to the team on:

- What they achieved

- What problems they encountered

- What they will work on next week


Key questions we have for you which we would like addressed in next weeks session:


1. The extent and robustness required of our model

2. The requirement of Monte Carlo usage for the simulation
